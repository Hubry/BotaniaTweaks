Botania Tweaks
==============

A little mod containing tweaks to Botania. Mainly focused around adding more configuration options, tiny conveniences, increasing the challenge, or just silly things. All tweaks are configurable.

Some patches use an ASM coremod; these are marked with a « symbol in the below list. Please yell at me if you get VerifyErrors so I can fix it.

Current features:
* mana fluxfields you can tweak to match your modpack's FE ecosystem
* use dispensers on glass bottles in the End to make Ender Air *(tentative mechanic)*
* crafttweakable agglomeration plate
  * with a custom multiblock
  * option to consume or replace the blocks in the multiblock
  * jei support *(that's only KINDA broken!)*
* POTATIC EXPANSION: 
  * put tiny potato in flower pot!!!
  * octuple compressed tiny potato w/ glorius rainbow color
  * LOVABLE and HUGGABLE, just like the original
  * spent way too much time on this
* « passive decay hard mode
  * « make any flower you want passive decay
  * « reduce the passive decay timer
* « big buffs to underutilized & cool mana sources
  * « big entropinnyum buff
  * « big spectrolus buff
  * « big buff to manastorm charge mana output 
    * ("wait, those even had mana output?" you ask? mmmhmm)
* auto-place corporea sparks when you place funnels, crystal cubes, etc

Planned features:
* any other little tweaks I can think of
* pre end corporea hnnnng
* unlock petal apothecary items
* does that shitty corproea-spark-augment idea belong here? probably too big to asm
* *maybe* patch entropinnyum tnt duplication
