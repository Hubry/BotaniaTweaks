Botania Tweaks
==============

A little mod containing tweaks to Botania. Mainly focused around adding more configuration options, tiny conveniences, increasing the challenge, or just silly things. All the tweaks are configurable.

Build Instructions
==================

Previously you had to download and deobfuscate a bunch of crap before compiling, but now you don't have to, because Hubry is awesome, and showed me how to use CurseForge maven.

You might also want to grab a copy of ModTweaker - i'm using 4.0.13 right now - to use some of its Botania ZenScript features in your test scripts. Please don't actually *depend* on it.

Featureset
==========

I used to have a giant list here but it always got out of sync with the one I keep on [my CurseForge page](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/botania-tweaks) so just go there!

Portions of this code were adapted from Botania, by Vazkii. I used to maintain a list of classes that I copied from and/or modified but it got really long and outdated. Oh well.

I take this all too seriously.
